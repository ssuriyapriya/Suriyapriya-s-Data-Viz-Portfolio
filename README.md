# Portfolio
This portfolio showcases projects from my "Telling Stories with Data" course at Carnegie Mellon University. Here, you'll find a collection of data-driven narratives and visualizations that highlight my ability to transform complex information into clear and compelling stories.

# About me
Hello! My name is Suriyapriya (she/her). I’m a second-year Master’s student in Health Care Analytics and Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests include data visualization, applied machine learning, and decision analytics in healthcare operations.  
Outside academics, I enjoy singing and playing Guitar.

# What I hope to learn
I’m taking this course to refine my ability to communicate complex information through data. I plan to deepen my technical skills in creating narrative visualizations and interactive dashboards while also developing a strong framework for thoughtful design critique. Ultimately, I want to master an accessibility-first approach, which I believe is essential for communicating health data ethically and effectively.

This is my first data visualization assignment, where I analyze and visually represent a dataset on government debt. For my visualization, I decided to group the countries into broader regions and show their Debt-to-GDP ratio trends over time. Instead of focusing on individual countries, I wanted to emphasize regional patterns and how debt burdens evolved differently across the world between 1995 and 2019. I used distinct colors for each region to make the lines easy to follow, while also keeping the color palette balanced so that no single region overwhelms the others. The title and source are clear so that viewers immediately know what the chart is showing and where the data came from.

A key part of my design choice was in the color scheme: regions with Debt-to-GDP ratios consistently above 100% were assigned colors in the brown/orange family, while those staying below 100% were shown in shades of blue. Within each group, I used light-to-dark shading to represent lower to higher values. Thus, the chart not only separates high-debt versus lower-debt regions at a glance, but it also shows relative differences within each category. For example, Southern Europe and Asia Pacific are darker browns, signaling very high levels, while lighter blues like Latin America reflect much lower ratios.

My design goal was to highlight long-term shifts rather than short-term fluctuations. For example, Southern Europe consistently shows some of the highest ratios, while Latin America and Eastern Europe remain much lower. Grouping by region makes these differences more visible than if I had kept each country separate. Compared to the heatmap I created earlier, I think this redesign is more effective because it allows me to tell a clearer story about how regions diverge over time. The heatmap was useful for spotting country-level variation, but this line visualization makes broader patterns and comparisons across regions stand out more clearly.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
A significant two-part project applying the 'Critique by Design' methodology. This assignment involves a detailed analysis of an existing data visualization to identify its strengths and weaknesses, followed by a comprehensive redesign to improve its clarity, impact, and effectiveness.

## Final project
My final project for this course, developed over several weeks. This comprehensive project involves selecting a unique dataset, crafting a compelling narrative, and designing and building a polished data visualization to tell that story. The project is broken down into three main parts, culminating in a final presentation.

Part I: Project Proposal and Initial Sketches
This phase covers the initial research, dataset selection, and a formal proposal outlining the project's goals, intended audience, and scope.
[Part I](final-project-part-one)

Part II: Draft and Peer Critique
This stage focuses on developing a complete draft of the visualization based on the proposal. This version was presented during an in-class critique to gather feedback for refinement.
[Part II](final-project-part-two)

Part III: Final Visualization and Presentation
The final submission includes the completed, polished data visualization and materials from the final in-class presentation.
[Part III](final-project-part-three)
