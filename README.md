# Portfolio
This portfolio showcases projects from my "Telling Stories with Data" course at Carnegie Mellon University. Here, you'll find a collection of data-driven narratives and visualizations that highlight my ability to transform complex information into clear and compelling stories.

# About me
Hello! My name is Suriyapriya (she/her). I’m a second-year Master’s student in Health Care Analytics and Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests include data visualization, applied machine learning, and decision analytics in healthcare operations.  
Outside academics, I enjoy singing and playing Guitar.

# What I hope to learn
I’m taking this course to refine my ability to communicate complex information through data. I plan to deepen my technical skills in creating narrative visualizations and interactive dashboards while also developing a strong framework for thoughtful design critique. Ultimately, I want to master an accessibility-first approach, which I believe is essential for communicating health data ethically and effectively.

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
This is my first data visualization assignment, where I analyze and visually represent a dataset on government debt. This page documents my design process, from initial sketches to the final product, applying the foundational principles of data visualization discussed in class.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
A significant two-part project applying the 'Critique by Design' methodology. This assignment involves a detailed analysis of an existing data visualization to identify its strengths and weaknesses, followed by a comprehensive redesign to improve its clarity, impact, and effectiveness.

## Final project
My final project for this course, developed over several weeks. This comprehensive project involves selecting a unique dataset, crafting a compelling narrative, and designing and building a polished data visualization to tell that story. The project is broken down into three main parts, culminating in a final presentation.

Part I: Project Proposal and Initial Sketches
This phase covers the initial research, dataset selection, and a formal proposal outlining the project's goals, intended audience, and scope.
[Part I](final-project-part-one)

Part II: Draft and Peer Critique
This stage focuses on developing a complete draft of the visualization based on the proposal. This version was presented during an in-class critique to gather feedback for refinement.
[Part II](final-project-part-two)

Part III: Final Visualization and Presentation
The final submission includes the completed, polished data visualization and materials from the final in-class presentation.
[Part III](final-project-part-three)
