# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference: 

- Web page URL: https://ssuriyapriya.github.io/Suriyapriya-s-Data-Viz-Portfolio/
- This repository: https://github.com/ssuriyapriya/Suriyapriya-s-Data-Viz-Portfolio/

# Portfolio
This portfolio showcases projects from my "Telling Stories with Data" course at Carnegie Mellon University. Here, you'll find a collection of data-driven narratives and visualizations that highlight my ability to transform complex information into clear and compelling stories.

# About me
Hello! My name is Suriyapriya (she/her). I’m a second-year Master’s student in Health Care Analytics and Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests include data visualization, applied machine learning, and decision analytics in healthcare operations.  
Outside academics, I enjoy singing and playing Guitar.

# What I hope to learn
I’m taking this course to refine my ability to communicate complex information through data. I plan to deepen my technical skills in creating narrative visualizations and interactive dashboards while also developing a strong framework for thoughtful design critique. Ultimately, I want to master an accessibility-first approach, which I believe is essential for communicating health data ethically and effectively.
