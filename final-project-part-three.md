# The final data story
[The Domino Effect: How a Missed Visit Steals a Hospital Bed](https://preview.shorthand.com/CSJ3NCKNzySEJgId)

# Changes made since Part II
After finishing Part II, my main goal was to make the connection between missed appointments (outpatient problem) and full hospital beds (inpatient problem) much clearer. My user research showed that people understood each problem, but they needed to see how they directly affected each other. 

To fix this, I added a clear sentence right after talking about missed appointments. This helps guide the reader smoothly, showing them that these aren't separate issues but parts of one bigger problem. Also, because users liked how I highlighted important parts of charts, I did the same for the "Patient Load by Specialization" chart. This helps everyone quickly spot which departments, like Pediatrics, are very busy. The aim was to make the whole story flow better and hit home the main message that everything in a patient's journey is connected. 

Additionally, to make the suggested solutions more tangible for hospital administrators, I decided to create a conceptual visualization of a software dashboard. This visual would show how real-time bed availability and cancellations could be tracked, directly illustrating the impact of an integrated system and strengthening the call to action.

## The audience
The main people I want this story to reach are **Hospital Administrators**, specifically those who manage outpatient clinics or inpatient departments. My goal was to tell a story using data that speaks to their daily challenges and gives them clear ideas on how to make the hospital run better.

To make sure I was talking to them in the right way, I interviewed three people who think like professionals: an MBA student, a healthcare analyst, and an MSPPM student. I picked them because they are good at looking at systems and understanding data, much like hospital leaders, but they were new to my specific project, so their feedback was fresh.

Their feedback taught me a lot. For example, they all understood the two problems (missed appointments and long stays), but two of them said I needed to show the link between them more strongly. This directly led me to add that clearer connection in the story. They also loved how I highlighted important numbers in my charts, which confirmed that this was a good way to show what's important. While one person thought the story was a good length and another thought it could be shorter, it showed me that keeping it clear and to the point was essential. All these insights helped me make sure the final story was easy to follow, impactful, and truly useful for hospital managers.

## Final design decisions
Making this data story involved several important design choices to make it clear and powerful for hospital administrators.

First, getting the story's flow right was key. My user research showed I needed to clearly connect the missed appointments problem with the full beds problem. So, I added a special part in the story that explains this link directly. This helped guide the reader through the "domino effect" instead of making them feel like they were looking at two separate issues.

Second, users really liked how I highlighted key parts of my charts. I decided to do this consistently throughout the story, for example, highlighting the busiest departments in the "Patient Load by Specialization" chart. This simple visual trick helps administrators quickly see the most important data points.

Third, I focused on using simple words. I knew hospital leaders are busy, so I wanted to avoid complicated terms. This helps them understand the message quickly and easily.

Fourth, the end of the story, the call to action, was changed to be very direct. Instead of just pointing out problems, it now suggests clear steps like "get a smarter booking system". This gives administrators tangible ideas they can think about.

Fifth, to make the proposed solutions feel more real, I used Gemini to create a picture of what a "software dashboard" could look like. This image shows how available beds and cancellations could be seen in real-time, helping the audience imagine how a new system might work to solve the bed management problem. This creative choice helped make the call to action much more impactful.

Finally, the whole look and feel of the Shorthand story, including colors and fonts, was chosen to be professional and trustworthy. The charts from Tableau were kept clean and easy to read, making sure nothing distracted from the main message. This whole process really taught me that even with great data, how you tell the story—its flow, visual hints, and simple language—is what truly makes it work and encourages people to act.

## AI acknowledgements
ChatGPT and Gemini were used as learning and development tools for this project, following the course guidelines. I used them to understand and fix technical steps for creating specific charts in Tableau, like calculated fields and notes. They also helped me learn how to put Tableau Public charts into the Shorthand platform. Specifically, Gemini helped me create the picture of the "software dashboard" to visually show the solutions I was suggesting.

# Final thoughts
This project has been a great learning experience, showing me every step of telling a story with data, from finding the data to sharing ideas that could actually help. The biggest takeaway was how much user feedback mattered in making the final story better. It showed me that even with the best data, how you tell the story, how it flows, what visual hints you give, and how simply you explain things, is what truly makes it work and gets people to take action. I didn't have enough time to build a working version of the dashboard, which would have been exciting, but the picture I created helped show the idea clearly. I'm most proud of how I managed to connect the problems of missed appointments and full hospital beds, turning them into one clear and powerful message for hospital administrators.
